As a fullstack web developer, UI/UX designer, and avid open source contributor, I've spent countless hours tinkering with code, perfecting designs, and pushing the limits of what's possible on the web. When I'm not busy creating visually stunning and intuitive interfaces, you can find me diving into the world of cloud and DevOps, or using my video editing skills to craft compelling stories. All in all, I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for constantly learning and improving my skills. Currently, I am doing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.
